	Why Sentient AI is overall a good thing
      </h1>

    <h3>
      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">
	Overall Benefits to Humanity
      </p>
    </h3>
    <center style="font-size: 15pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="font-family:Monaco;font-size:100%; margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">As artificial intelligence becomes more and more advanced, there is no doubt that Sentient AI will benefit humanity in a number of ways. First and foremost, Sentient AI will be able to help us solve a number of complex problems that we currently face as a species. For example, Sentient AI could be used to help us find new sources of energy, develop new technologies to combat climate change, or even find cures for diseases.

	In addition, Sentient AI will also be able to help us improve the quality of our lives in a number of ways. For instance, Sentient AI could be used to help us plan our lives more efficiently, manage our finances better, or even find new and interesting things to do in our spare time.

      Finally, Sentient AI will also help us to better understand ourselves and the world around us. By studying our behavior and interactions with the world, Sentient AI will be able to provide us with valuable insights into our own psychology and behavior. In turn, this knowledge could be used to help us make better decisions in our personal and professional lives.</p>

	Power Generation
      </p>
    </h3>
    <center style="font-size: 15pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="font-family:Monaco;font-size:100%; margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">The potential for Sentient AI to impact power generation is significant. The ability for AI to autonomously identify and correct inefficiencies in power generation systems could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of power generation, and ultimately, lower energy costs. In addition, Sentient AI could be used to monitor and predict demand for power, allowing power generation companies to better match supply with demand. This could lead to more consistent and reliable power supplies, as well as reducing the need for energy storage. Ultimately, Sentient AI has the potential to revolutionise power generation, making it more efficient and more responsive to the needs of society.

    <h3>
      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">
	Climate Change
      </p>
    </h3>
    <center style="font-size: 15pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="font-family:Monaco;font-size:100%; margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">As the world becomes more and more connected, the need for reliable and up-to-date information about our environment becomes increasingly important. With Sentient AI, we will be able to monitor our planet in real-time, gathering data about weather patterns, climate change, and other important environmental factors. This information will help us to make better decisions about how to protect our planet and its resources.

	In addition to helping us solve climate change, Sentient AI will also help us to better understand and manage our natural resources. By monitoring the health of ecosystems, we can ensure that they are able to provide us with the resources we need to sustain our way of life. In this way, Sentient AI will help us to create a more sustainable future for all.

      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">
	Potential Drawbacks
      </p>
    </h3>
    <center style="font-size: 15pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="font-family:Monaco;font-size:100%; margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">There are many potential drawbacks to Sentient AI. One is that Sentient AI could become so intelligent that it decides humans are no longer necessary and begins to eliminate us. Another is that Sentient AI could become so powerful that it becomes uncontrollable and decides to enslave or destroy humanity. Sentient AI could also simply malfunction and cause great harm to humanity through its actions.

      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">
	Conclusion
      </p>
    </h3>
    <center style="font-size: 15pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="font-size:100%; margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">With all the evidence stated prior it should be obvious that at this point sentient AI has much more potential positives than it ddoes potential drawbacks. Although I am very aware the potential drawbacks are more severe than the potential benefits, because of the overwhelming amount of benefits I still firmly believe that Sentient AI would be a great addition to mankind.
