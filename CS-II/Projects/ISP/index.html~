	On the technical front things could be going worse but there is a lot of problems that need urgent fixing for this to be a viable product. Firstly we have the problem of having to host our link on ngrok right now which causes the link to change everytime while we search for a free way to host a django server on a stable link. This could easily be solved by paying a subscription of $5 per month but that seems like a waste of money. Secondly theres the problem of integrating our Django server with a SQL databse to store user information like username, password, and avatar.

	This is an extrmely tough time for us to have to be working on the ISP with the impending quarter closing, tests in every class, and the SAT coming up pretty soon which is extremely important for us to do good on Junior year. But yet through all these problems weve found time to work on the ISP this past week which I am very proud of.

	This is the first week im going to be able to say this and it makes me extremely happy, All of our group members have been discussing thiings together cohesively in a group chat! This took much longer than expected but im so happy it is finally happening and we can all stay cohesive and on the same page in terms of what to do.

	Our biggest technological decision this week was settling fully on using python integrated with html and css because python has a ton of online resources for help if were ever struggling and html and css are standard for any coder and weve been working with them all year just like on this website now

	We realized there would be a problem in having many of our group members in different classes so weve made a group chat so that all of us members can associate with eachother and contact eachother whenever we need help on the isp or need to discuss aspects of it.

      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;"> The main technical challenge i can imagine running into is making the website look nice and professional. Its easy to make a website but not easy to make a good website and of course i would like my ISP to be as good as possible. Im hoping i can get help from my team to decide the color schemes and overall design of the website so I can try to implement it to the best of my abilities.

      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">Scheduling for the most part should not be a big issue because all of our group members are in close contact with eachother and can talk to eachother at any time. But my main scheduling concern is how one of our team members often finds himself busy with soccer practice and unable to have much freetime to work on schoolwork each night. While this is my main concern i really dont think it will be a problem because that team member is hard working and likes to put in his maximum effort into computer science each and every assignment.

      Roles overview:
    </h2>
    <center style="font-size: 20pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">For the first week of working on our ISP (SEL check in) we have been tasked with assigning roles throughout our group. There are five roles required on all teams: Development Engineer, QA Engineer, Project Manager, Product Manager, and Release Engineer. The Development Engineer will be the person who designs the product. They will also be tasked with the main chunk of code although everyone will participate in some aspect of coding this project. The QA (quality assurance) Engineer will create tests to run the project though to make sure that project is up to code (pun). They will then report the issues back to the group so we can work together to fix them. The project manager is responible for planning, organizing, and overseeing the work of the team to achieve specific goals and meet project objectives. They will be tasked with keeping us on schedule as well as contributing to other aspects of the project. The Product Manager is responsible for gathering and analyzing market and customer data. They will work with the rest of this group to make the product easy to use. The Release Engineer will be responsible for building, testing, and deploying software releases. They work closely with Development Engineer and QA Engineer to ensure that the code is properly integrated and tested, and that it can be easily deployed to production environments. When we assigned these roles withing the group we tried to work with our strengths and weaknesses. I have the most history with coding so we decided that I would be the Development Engineer. Robel is really good at finding errors within code and often helps us find errors in our own code se he was chosen as the QA engineer. Because we only have four people and there are five roles somebody will have to take on two roles. Nahom volunteered to be both the release engineer and project manager because the role of Release Engineer is mainly comprised of uploading versions to github and he will be able to handle both roles. Azmer volunteered to be the Product Manager because he is good at comprising schedules.
