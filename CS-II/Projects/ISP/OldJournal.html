Upon visiting the page, it asks to enter a class code. One you enter the code (Only one at this point is ABCDEF), a valid one will add you to the classroom and an invalid one will result in an error that says no class found. Each Code is randomly generated at the creation of a classroom, so it should be easy to expand

      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">
	One technical Challenge we were facing for the Classes page is how the class codes are generated. A 6 Letter randomly generated code would be great, but django mostly uses uuid when it comes to randomly generated data values, and so those are used as placeholders for the time being. This unfortunatly means that Classrooms made will have a class code 36 characters long that could look something like "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"

	A Scheduling Issue Me and the other members faced was multitasking the growing tasks in the isp with thier workload. At this time it doesn't seem to be an issue, and as the school year comes to an end new material will no longer be presented and students can focus more on the ISP, hopefully boosting the productivity.

An email is sent to them with the custom email moodandgrasp@gmail.com with the details and info on how to reset their password.

	Now that the login and register pages are complete, We are putting our focus on Student and Teacher Accounts. Teachers should be able to create classrooms and host MoodAndGrasp Charts for their student to survey in. At this point, we don't have a seperate login page for teachers, and that will be made in the future.

	Added ChartJS Compatability in <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-MoodAndGrasp/commit/1f5780810a2e416671da2cdcf831827069f024e8">this commit.</a> ChartJS Will allow us to dynamically update the graph whenever someone's grasp of a concept or mood shifts. With its simple integration with Django, it can efficently access the SQL Data stored in the database. I integrated it with the server to ensure it would work, so at this moment in time just the framework and a testing graph has been added.

	Computer Science work is beginning to become a lot. With the ISP, Merlin Missions, and Java/Python courses its begun being difficult to juggle this class and the member's other classes as well, which is understandable so less work will be assigned this week, however more will need to be done in the future to make up for this difference.

	On the technical front things could be going worse but there is a lot of problems that need urgent fixing for this to be a viable product. Firstly we have the problem of having to host our link on ngrok right now which causes the link to change everytime while we search for a free way to host a django server on a stable link. This could easily be solved by paying a subscription of $5 per month but that seems like a waste of money. Secondly theres the problem of integrating our Django server with a SQL databse to store user information like username, password, and avatar.

	This is an extrmely tough time for us to have to be working on the ISP with the impending quarter closing, tests in every class, and the SAT coming up pretty soon which is extremely important for us to do good on Junior year. But yet through all these problems weve found time to work on the ISP this past week which I am very proud of.

This took much longer than expected but im so happy it is finally happening and we can all stay cohesive and on the same page in terms of what to do.

While this is my main concern i really dont think it will be a problem because that team member is hard working and likes to put in his maximum effort into computer science each and every assignment.

      Roles overview:

    <center style="font-size: 20pt; font-family:'Times New Roman'; line-height:2">
      <p style="margin-left:300px; margin-right:300px;">For the first week of working on our ISP (SEL check in) we have been tasked with assigning roles throughout our group. There are five roles required on all teams: Development Engineer, QA Engineer, Project Manager, Product Manager, and Release Engineer. The Development Engineer will be the person who designs the product. They will also be tasked with the main chunk of code although everyone will participate in some aspect of coding this project. The QA (quality assurance) Engineer will create tests to run the project though to make sure that project is up to code (pun). They will then report the issues back to the group so we can work together to fix them. The project manager is responible for planning, organizing, and overseeing the work of the team to achieve specific goals and meet project objectives. They will be tasked with keeping us on schedule as well as contributing to other aspects of the project. The Product Manager is responsible for gathering and analyzing market and customer data. They will work with the rest of this group to make the product easy to use. The Release Engineer will be responsible for building, testing, and deploying software releases. They work closely with Development Engineer and QA Engineer to ensure that the code is properly integrated and tested, and that it can be easily deployed to production environments. When we assigned these roles withing the group we tried to work with our strengths and weaknesses. I have the most history with coding so we decided that I would be the Development Engineer. Robel is really good at finding errors within code and often helps us find errors in our own code se he was chosen as the QA engineer. Because we only have four people and there are five roles somebody will have to take on two roles. Nahom volunteered to be both the release engineer and project manager because the role of Release Engineer is mainly comprised of uploading versions to github and he will be able to handle both roles. Azmer volunteered to be the Product Manager because he is good at comprising schedules.
